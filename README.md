# bitmap

This should take in a palette bmp and transfrom the colors. I worked with Rachel Burke, Heidi Larsen, Maria Romero, Kat Beame, Phillip Nguyen, and Greg Magsdick. In addition, I also took inspiration from the code review we did today in class.

Usage: CLI

type node index.js into the command line from the project directory.
